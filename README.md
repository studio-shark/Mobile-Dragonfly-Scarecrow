## 🌾 Core Concept

The Mobile Dragonfly Scarecrow is a revolutionary agricultural technology designed to replace chemical pesticides. It utilizes swarms of autonomous, dragonfly-inspired drones that emit a targeted, high-frequency acoustic signal to repel insect pests without harming crops or beneficial pollinators. This application serves as the official interactive showcase for the complete, patent-ready invention package.

## ✨ Key Features

The application is a dual-mode experience, providing both a high-level cinematic overview and a detailed technical deep-dive.

### Mode 1: Cinematic Swarm Visualization

The primary, default view is a stunning, data-driven visualization inspired by the Air Loom flight tracking aesthetic.

- **Real-Time 3D Environment:** A vast, atmospheric farm scene rendered at dusk to create a high-contrast, cinematic feel.
- **Air Loom Flight Paths:** Luminous, flowing ribbon trails visualize the flight path of each drone, with colors dynamically representing data points like speed or acoustic intensity.
- **Coordinated Swarm Dynamics:** Watch a swarm of 10-20 drones operate in a coordinated, grid-like pattern over the fields.
- **Interactive Data Layers:** A collapsible UI panel allows users to toggle real-time statistics, a pest density heat map, and a crop health layer to see the system's impact.
- **Full Camera & Time Control:** Orbit, pan, and zoom the camera, follow a specific drone, or use the timeline scrubber to control the simulation speed.

### Mode 2: Interactive Documentation Hub

Accessible via a toggle from the main visualization, this mode allows users to explore the deep technical details of the invention.

- **3D Technical Inspector:** Isolate a single, high-detail 3D model of the drone. Click on interactive hotspots to view detailed component specifications and trigger an animated "Exploded View."
- **Blueprint Explorer:** A high-resolution viewer for the six official patent-ready technical drawings, complete with interactive annotations.
- **Interactive Physics Lab:** A physics sandbox with sliders to adjust parameters (e.g., mass, speed, battery) and see real-time calculations for flight endurance, power consumption, and more.
- **Production & Cost Dashboard:** Visualize the manufacturing data with interactive cost breakdowns and a scalability calculator.
- **Searchable Documentation Library:** A central repository for all technical documents, with deep cross-linking between the library and the other interactive modules.
